# Social media<br>
##### The project was created with React.js
### Options that are available in the social media :
Login,logout,subscription, unsubscription, changing your profile (change photo, status, links to your other profiles etc.),showing other profiles etc.
## There were used libraries such as : axios,formik,yup,redux-thunk,react-router,react-spring etc.

P.s. because of problems with CORS policy from the server side(API), this project can`t be deployed on hosting<br>
so if you want to see how it works, you should run it locally<br>
